    // A chart removed from the visual tree must be collectable — its inner MotionCanvas /
    // SKCanvasView occupy substantial memory and the original report describes them piling up
    // page-after-page on Maui 8. The symptom no longer reproduces on Maui 10 (Application
    // events are routed through a WeakEventManager) but the same invariant — unloaded chart
    // is GC-able — should hold on every Xaml platform we ship. This canary fires if a future
    // platform release (or our own code) regresses to a strong app-level root on charts:
    // a `this`-capturing event subscription that's never detached, an accumulator field, a
    // static collection, etc.
    //
    // Each platform's Test/Dispose/View exposes `ChangeContent()` that swaps the inner
    // content for a fresh one and returns the chart objects from the swapped-out instance.
    // We weak-ref the charts directly because Maui 10's Element.Parent is a WeakReference,
    // so testing leaks via "did the parent page survive?" silently misses real chart leaks.

    // the user just switched AWAY from, even though the chart's element is still
    // mounted in the window — UIKit just hides the platform UIView. The #1725
    // Apple-side handler-disconnect ran on that Unloaded and set Handler=null;
    // MAUI then never raised Loaded when the user returned to the tab and the
    // chart went permanently blank. The fix gates the disconnect on Window ==
    // null, so transient tab-switch unloads no longer drop the handler.
    //
    // This is a focused contract test: push a TabbedPage modally and verify the
    // hidden tab's chart Handler stays alive after the switch. The buggy version
    // failed the Handler null assertion on iOS (Window != null but
    // DisconnectHandler still ran); on every other XAML platform the disconnect
    // is gated by `#if IOS || MACCATALYST` so the assertion always holds.
